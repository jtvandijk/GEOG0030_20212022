This is by no means an extensive data list, but summarises data used within some of the practicals alongside some additional data sources. Note You are not limited to using these datasets for your coursework assignment and/or dissertation. 11.1 Open Data The following websites contain Open Data or links to Open Data from several respectable data providers: Google dataset search Tesco store data (London) NHS data (ready for R) US City Open Data Census nomis ONS geoportal UK data service ONS Edina (e.g. OS mastermap) Open Topography USGS Earth Explorer Geofabrik (OSM data) Global weather data (points) London data store AirBnB data NASA SocioEconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) UN environmental data explorer World pop World pop github DIVA-GIS DEFRA US Census data TfL open data TfL cycling data EU tourism data NASA EARTHDATA Camden air action King’s College data on air pollution Uber travel time data Eurostat London Tube PM2.5 levels Bike docking data in an R package UK COVID data R package for COVID data Tidy Tuesday data (although look for spatial data) Correct statistical tests 11.2 CDRC Data UG students can apply to CDRC for some of their Safeguarded data. There is a process to access these datasets, detailed on CDRC website. To access any CDRC safeguarded data, you will need to follow this process. It normally takes 4-5 weeks for your application to be granted. Note Given that the application can take several weeks, the safeguarded CDRC datasets may be useful for your dissertation work but not for the GEOG0030 coursework assignment. Do keep in mind that some of the CDRC datasets are marked as Open Data and do not require this application process. In this case, you can just register on the site and download. As part of the process, you will need to say in your application why you want that specific dataset and what you are going to do with it. You will also need to have at least thought about the ethical implications of using that data and provide this with your data application (alongside your standard ethics application). In terms of specific datasets available, you can apply for: Bicycle Sharing System Docking Station Observations CDRC Modelled Ethnicity Proportions - LSOA Geography NHS Hospital Admission Rates by Ethnic Group and other Characteristics Local Data Company - SmartStreetSensor Footfall Data – Research Aggregated data Speedchecker Broadband Internet Speed Tests FCA Financial Lives Survey 11.3 Other Data Some other webpages to explore: Free GIS data; long list with lots of GIS datasets on many different topics and covering many different areas.
