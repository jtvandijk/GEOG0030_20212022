<br />

Welcome to **Geocomputation**, a course that introduces you to both the principles of spatial analysis and the use of programming for data analysis.

Over the next ten weeks, you’ll learn about the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis whilst implementing small research projects, first using Q-GIS, and then using the R programming language within the R-Studio software environment. You’ll learn how to find, manage and clean spatial, demographic and socio-economic data sets, and then analyse them using core spatial and statistical analysis techniques. 

## Moodle {-}
[Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/) is the central point of your learning experience for GEOG0114 and contains everything you need to know about it. It's where you'll find links to all lecture content, reading materials, planned activities as well as key module and assessment information
