Over the next ten weeks, you’ll learn about the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis whilst implementing small research projects, first using Q-GIS, and then using the R programming language within the R-Studio software environment. You will learn how to find, manage and clean spatial, demographic and socio-economic data sets, and then analyse them using core spatial and statistical analysis techniques. Moodle Moodle is the central point of your learning experience for GEOG0030 and contains everything you need to know about it. It is where you will find links to all lecture content, reading materials, planned activities as well as key module and assessment information Module overview The topics covered over the next ten weeks are: Week Section Topic 1 Foundational Concepts Geocomputation: An Introduction 2 Foundational Concepts GIScience and GIS software 3 Foundational Concepts Cartography and Visualisation 4 Foundational Concepts Programming for Statistical Analysis 5 Foundational Concepts Programming for Spatial Analysis Reading week Reading week 6 Core Spatial Analysis Analysing Spatial Patterns I: Geometric Operations 7 Core Spatial Analysis Analysing Spatial Patterns II: Spatial Autocorrelation 8 Core Spatial Analysis Analysing Spatial Patterns III: Point Pattern Analysis 9 Advanced Spatial Analysis Rasters, Zonal Statistics and Interpolation 10 Advanced Spatial Analysis Geodemographics "],["troubleshooting.html", "Troubleshooting", " Troubleshooting Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships. However, at times it can be difficult to work with - particularly when we combine this with learning how to program at the same time. You will get lots of error messages and have software crash, you will end up with bugs in your code that are difficult to find, and you may spend a whole day trying to track down a single data set. But the rewards of learning how to do all of this will become apparent. If you need specific assistance with this course please: Attend the weekly Geocomputation help sessions to ask questions directly to the PGTA. Post in the respective r-help channels within the Geocomputation Team. Ask a question at the end of a lecture or during the computer practical. Check the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to the assessment (more information will be provided at the end or reading week) Attend the Department’s Coding Therapy sessions that are run on a weekly basis Due to the size of the class we will only reply to tech and R help messages on Teams so all students can see the discussion. We’d also encourage you to monitor the tech-help or r-help channels and contribute to/answer questions as/if you can! Creating a small community across our course will help all of us in the long-run. If after pursuing all these avenues you still need help, you can book into our office hours. These meetings are to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material/assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module. "],["geocomputation-an-introduction.html", "1 Geocomputation: An Introduction 1.1 Lecture recording 1.2 Reading list 1.3 Getting started 1.4 Software 1.5 File management", " 1 Geocomputation: An Introduction This week’s lecture provided you with a thorough introduction into what is Geocomputation, outlining how and why it is different to a traditional ‘GIScience’ course. We set the scene for the remainder of the module and explained how the foundational concepts that you will learn about in the first half of term fit together to form the overall Geocomputation curriculum. For this week only, there is no practical per se, but you will need to complete a few practical tasks in preparation for our future practicals. 1.1 Lecture recording Lecture W1 1.2 Reading list Reading #1 Reading #2 1.3 Getting started Over the next few weeks, we will be taking a deeper look at many of these foundational concepts that will ultimately enable you to be able to confidently and competently analyse spatial data using both programming and GIS software. As you might guess, you will therefore be going on many learning curves over the coming weeks - some that may feel familiar (e.g. applying descriptive statistics) and others that are more challenging (e.g. learning how to write code and debug it as you find errors). To help with this, we highly recommend that you try to stay organised with your work, including taking notes and making yourself a coding handbook. We would also suggest to list the different data sets you come across - and importantly, the scales and different projections you use them at - more on this in the next two weeks. Finally, you should also make notes about the different spatial analysis techniques you will come across, including the different properties they assess and parameters they require to run. Furthermore, over the next nine weeks, you will learn how to plan, structure and conduct your own spatial analysis using programming – whilst making decisions on how to best present your work, which is a crucial aspect of any type of investigation but of particular relevance to your dissertation. Establishing an organised file system, for both your data and your documents, is essential to working effectively and efficiently as a researcher, whether in Geocomputation, Spatial Data Science or any other application you might think of! 1.4 Software This course primarily uses the R data science programming language and we strongly advise you complete the assignment using it. We briefly touch upon QGIS in the first few weeks to give you a basic foundation in spatial analysis alongside the range of spatial software available. Note Please follow the instructions below before the first hands-on practical session. 1.4.1 QGIS Installation QGIS is an open-source graphic user interface GIS with many community developed add-on packages (or plugins) that provide additional functionality to the software. You can download and install QGIS on your personal machine by going to the QGIS website: [Link]. Note We recommend installing the Long Term Release as this version should be the most stable, recent version. After installation, start QGIS to see if the installation was successful and no errors are shown after startup. 1.4.2 R and RStudio Installation R is both a programming language and software environment - in the form of RStudio- originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. R’s great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system, and is free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a huge user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical, and importantly for us, geographical tasks. Installing R takes a few relatively simple steps involving two programmes. First there is the R programme itself. Follow these steps to get it installed on your computer: Go to your nearest CRAN mirror: [Link] If you use a Windows computer, click on Download R for Windows. Then click on base. Download and install R 4.1.1 for Windows. If you use a Mac computer, click on Download R for macOS and download and install R-4.1.1.pkg That is it! You now have installed the latest version of R on your own machine. However, to make working with R a little bit easier we also need to install something called an Integrated Development Environment. We will use RStudio: Go to the official webpage of RStudio: [Link] Download and install RStudio Desktop on your computer (free version!) After this, start RStudio to see if the installation was successful. 1.4.3 UCL Desktop and RStudio Server As an alternative to installing QGIS and R with RStudio on your personal device, there are some other options. Firstly, both programmes are available through Desktop@UCL Anywhere as well as all UCL computer on campus. Specifically for R, there is also an RStudio server version available: open a web browser and navigate to UCL’s RStudio Server installation: [Link] You should be able to log in with your normal UCL username and password. After logging in, you should see the RStudio interface appear. Figure 1.1: The RStudio interface. Note If it is the first time you log on to RStudio server you may only see the RStudio interface appear once you have clicked on the start a new session button. More importantly: if you are not on campus, RStudio server will only work with an active Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection that links your personal computer into UCL’s network. Details on setting up a VPN connection can be found on UCL’s VPN connection guides: [Link] 1.4.4 A note on ArcGIS ArcGIS Pro (previously ArcMap) is the main commercial GIS software that you may have already used - or seen/heard about through other modules or even job adverts. We do not use ArcGIS Pro in our Practicals for several reasons: Computing requirements for ArcGIS Pro are substantial and it only operates on the Windows Operating System. For Mac users, using ArcGIS Pro (and ArcMap) would require using either a Virtual Machine or “splitting your own harddrive” to install a Windows OS (dualboot). It is proprietary software, which means you need a license to use the software. For those of us in education, the University covers the cost of this license, but when you leave, you will need to pay for a personal license (around £100! for non-commercial use) to continue using the software and repeat any analysis you have used the software for. Whilst ArcPro can use pure Python (and even R) as a programming language within it through scripts and notebooks, it primarily relies on its own ArcPy and ArcGIS API for Python packages to run the in-built tools and analytical functions. To use these packages, you still need a license which makes it difficult to share your code with others if they do not have their own ArcGIS license. Recent developments in the ArcPro software however does make it an attractive tool for spatial data science - it has cross-user functionality, from data analysts who like to use a tool called Notebooks for their code development, to those focused more on cartography and visualisation with in-built bridges to Adobe’s Creative Suite. We therefore do not want to put you off looking into ArcGIS in the future, but for this course, we want to ensure the reproducibility of work. Note The analysis for your coursework must be completed in R and QGIS (where permissible, see guidance that will be released at the end of Reading Week). 1.5 File management To get ready for our practicals, which start next week, we would like you to set-up a file management system as follows (either on your local computer, Desktop@UCL Anywhere or RStudio server). Create a GEOG0030 folder in your Documents folder on your computer (most likely inside a UCL or Undergraduate or Geography folder). Next, within your GEOG0030 folder, create the following subfolders: data slides maps qgis notes any other folder types you may think you need for this course (although you can of course add these as the module continues) Within your data folder, create the following subfolders: raw working final If you have have downloaded the lecture slides, move these into your slides folder. And that is it. You should now all be set up to start our practicals next week.
