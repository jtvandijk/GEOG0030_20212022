## CDRC Data
UG students can apply to CDRC for some of their Safeguarded data. There is a process to access these datasets, detailed on [CDRC website](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/using-our-data-services). To access any CDRC safeguarded data, you will need to follow this process. It normally takes 4-5 weeks for your application to be granted.

:::note
**Note**<br />
Given that the application can take several weeks, the safeguarded CDRC datasets may be useful for your dissertation work but not for the GEOG0030 coursework assignment. Do keep in mind that some of the CDRC datasets are marked as **Open Data** and do not require this application process. In this case, you can just register on the site and download. 
:::

As part of the process, you will need to say in your application why you want that specific dataset and what you are going to do with it. You will also need to have at least thought about the ethical implications of using that data and provide this with your data application (alongside your standard ethics application).
 
In terms of specific datasets available, you can apply for:

* [Bicycle Sharing System Docking Station Observations](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/bicycle-sharing-system-docking-station-observations)
* [CDRC Modelled Ethnicity Proportions - LSOA Geography]( https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/cdrc-modelled-ethnicity-proportions-lsoa-geography)
* [NHS Hospital Admission Rates by Ethnic Group and other Characteristics]( https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/nhs-hospital-admission-rates-ethnic-group-and-other-characteristics)
* [Local Data Company - SmartStreetSensor Footfall Data â€“ Research Aggregated data](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/local-data-company-smartstreetsensor-footfall-data-%E2%80%93-research-aggregated-data)
* [Speedchecker Broadband Internet Speed Tests](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/speedchecker-broadband-internet-speed-tests)
* [FCA Financial Lives Survey](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/fca-financial-lives-survey)

## Other Data
Some other webpages to explore:

* [Free GIS data](https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/); long list with lots of GIS datasets on many different topics and covering many different areas.
* [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets); general collection of datasets, although not limited to spatial data.
